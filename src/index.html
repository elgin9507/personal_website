              <p class="aboutme">
                With a background in Economics and Finance, I have long been captivated by computer technologies and their
                underlying mechanics. This passion motivated me to transition to a career in IT after working for a few
                years in the finance sector. In hindsight, while I missed having a formal IT education, I don't regret my
                finance studies,as they've proven valuable to my career and personal growth.
                <br><br>
                I recently reached the five-year mark in my software engineering career. Beginning with self-study to secure
                my first developer role, I have since gained hands-on experience with widely used technologies and real-world
                projects. My work has spanned diverse projects, largely with companies providing IT solutions. More details
                on my experience can be found in the relevant section of my profile.
                <br><br>
                Although my non-IT educational background initially posed challenges, especially in securing my first job,
                I overcame these through analytical thinking and a practical approach to tasks. My senior team members have
                consistently given me positive feedback on my work. To strengthen my theoretical IT foundation, I regularly
                engage in self-study, particularly in areas like data structures and algorithms.
                <br><br>
                My journey as a software developer has been rewarding both personally and for the stakeholders I work with.
                I'm looking forward not to stop it!
